Hello i am a college student i have created this program as my minor project so it may not work perfectly as i am a new programmer 
IF you want to use my program to get idea or just to know how a basic encryption program works you can use it
The entire program is written in c++ so you will need a c++ compiler
While running the program keep all the header and cpp file in one folder or it will give an error
